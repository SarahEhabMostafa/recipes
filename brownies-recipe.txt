Ingredients:
 - 1/2 cup vegetable oil
 - 1 cup sugar
 - 1 teaspoon vanilla
 - 2 large eggs
 - 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
 - 1/3 cup cocoa powder
 - 1/4 teaspoon salt
 - 1/2 cup flour

Directions:
 1. Preheat oven to 350°.
 2. Mix oil and sugar until well blended.
 3. Add eggs and vanilla; stir just until blended.
 4. Mix all dry ingredients in a separate bowl.
 5. Stir dry ingredients into the oil/sugar mixture.
 6. Pour into greased 9 x 9 square pan.
 7. Bake for 20 minutes or until sides just start to pull away from the pan.
 8. Cool completely before cutting.

Note:
I usually double the recipe and bake in a 9 x 13 pan. If you double the recipe, you will need to cook longer than 20 minutes.
